# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

This purpose of this project is to understand the Requirement Analysis phase of the Software Development Life cycle (SDLC). To understand how to structure, analyze, and document system requirements. To undestand how to utilize use case diagrams to show how actors interact with the system to achieve specifi goals.
