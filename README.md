# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

This purpose of this project is to understand the Requirement Analysis phase of the Software Development Life cycle (SDLC). To understand how to structure, analyze, and document system requirements. To undestand how to utilize use case diagrams to show how actors interact with the system to achieve specifi goals.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of gathering, defining, analzying and prioritizing the requirements of the proposed system. It's a crucial stage in the Software Development Life Cycle as it helps developer teams to identify key features and functionalities expected to be in the system and also define the scope (boundaries) of the system.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis is important for the following reasons:
- **Identification of requirements:** helps developers to understand what functionalities are expected by the stakeholders, to be in the system.
- **Define scope:** helps developers understand what to include in the system and what not to, clearly defining the boundaries of the system.
- **Basis for design and development:** provides a solid foundation  for the design and development phases that come later in the SDLC.
- **Facilitates Communication:** between the developers and stakeholders ensuring that both parties clearly understand what is expected.
